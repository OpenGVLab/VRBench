MAX_VIDEO_SUMMARY = """[00:00:00->00:10:00] The video documents the highlights of an equestrian competition, showing multiple riders and horses in different scenarios. At first, the scene shows a man in a helmet and riding gear, riding a well-trained brown horse and jumping over obstacles with ease. The scene then shifts to an indoor courtyard where people are playing badminton, but soon returns to images of equestrian events. Next, the video focuses on a woman in black jump shoes and a helmet as she rides around the arena, demonstrating great skill and the horse showing a very high level of training. As the competition progressed, spectators could see different riders, including those in red jackets, showing control of their horses in the riding arena. One of the riders was particularly impressive in his/her ability to not only control his/her horse, but also show great skill in the obstacle course. The video is interspersed with commentary on the race, mentioning the names of riders such as Puen Paris, who had to leave the race due to time constraints, and Natty Konkorian from Ho Sa Khua, who is described as a competitor from "far away". In addition, the video mentions an experienced female rider on a white horse who showed exceptional courage and skill at a crucial moment in the race. As the race progresses, the video captures some tense and exciting moments, such as the challenges faced by the riders near the end of the race and the speed and power of the horses as they jump the final obstacle. In particular, the video of the rider named Thida Kamonyakul details how she finished the race under time pressure, demonstrating how well she works with her horse. The whole video not only shows the glamor and competitiveness of equestrian competitions, but also conveys the love of the sport and the courage to take on challenges through different riders and horses. The video ends with a tribute to both rider and horse, emphasizing that horsemanship is not only a skill, but also an art that requires deep understanding and partnership between human and animal."""
